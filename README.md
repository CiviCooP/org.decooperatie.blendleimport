org.decooperatie.blendleimport
==============================

CiviCRM extension to import and process statistics and financial data from Blendle data files.  
Written specifically for [DeCooperatie.org](https://decooperatie.org), probably not that useful for other CiviCRM users.

This extension loads its initial configuration on install using [org.civicoop.configitems](https://github.com/CiviCooP/org.civicoop.configitems).  
The contact matching logic and UI is inspired by / partially borrowed from [uk.artfulrobot.civicrm.importhelper]( 
https://github.com/artfulrobot/uk.artfulrobot.civicrm.importhelper).
